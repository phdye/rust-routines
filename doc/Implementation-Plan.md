# Implementation Plan - Rust Routines

**Goroutines in Rust**

## Project Overview

### Vision

### Core Goals
- **Lightweight Execution**: M:N threading model with minimal overhead
- **Familiar API**: Go-inspired syntax adapted to Rust idioms
- **Safety First**: Leverage Rust's type system for compile-time concurrency safety
- **Performance**: Match or exceed native async/await performance
- **Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing Rust ecosystem

### Key Features
- Stackful coroutines with automatic scheduling
- CSP channels for communication
- Select statements for non-blocking operations
- Work-stealing scheduler with NUMA awareness
- Structured concurrency patterns
- Zero-cost abstractions where possible

### Design Principles

**1. M:N Threading Model**

- Growable stacks (start small, grow on demand)
- Stack pooling for allocation reuse
- Platform-specific assembly for context switching

**3. Channel Design**
- Type-safe channels with compile-time guarantees
- Both bounded and unbounded variants
- Select statement for multiplexing
- Zero-allocation fast path for common cases

**4. Safety Guarantees**
- No data races (enforced by Rust)

## API Design Examples

### Basic Usage
```rust
use rust_routines::routine;

fn main() {
    // Simple routine spawn
    routine::spawn(|| {
        println!("Hello from routine!");
    });
    
    // With move semantics
    let data = vec![1, 2, 3];
    routine::spawn(move || {
        println!("Data: {:?}", data);
    });
    
    routine::yield_now(); // Yield to scheduler
}
```

### Channels
```rust
use rust_routines::channel;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = channel::bounded(10);
    
    routine::spawn(move || {
        tx.send(42).unwrap();
    });
    
    routine::spawn(move || {
        let value = rx.recv().unwrap();
        println!("Received: {}", value);
    });
}
```

### Select Statement
```rust
use rust_routines::{select, channel};

fn main() {
    let (tx1, rx1) = channel::bounded(1);
    let (tx2, rx2) = channel::bounded(1);
    
    routine::spawn(move || {
        select! {
            val = rx1.recv() => println!("From rx1: {:?}", val),
            val = rx2.recv() => println!("From rx2: {:?}", val),
            default => println!("No data available"),
        }
    });
}
```

### Structured Concurrency
```rust
use rust_routines::routine::scope;

fn main() {
    let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    scope(|s| {
        for chunk in data.chunks(2) {
            s.spawn(move || {
                println!("Processing: {:?}", chunk);
            });
        }
    }); // Waits for all routines to complete
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Context Switching Overhead**: Optimize assembly, consider boost.context
- **Memory Fragmentation**: Implement stack pooling and reuse

### Adoption Risks
- **API Unfamiliarity**: Provide extensive docs and migration guides
- **Ecosystem Fragmentation**: Ensure compatibility layers
- **Performance Expectations**: Clear benchmarks and use-case guidance
- **Debugging Complexity**: Rich debugging and profiling tools
